          This side project started as a joke to help bring some joy to students
          at Tech Elevator. The Motivator v1 was a command line interface
          in Eclipse. The Motivator v2 was an attempt to use
          SpringMVC to integrate a seperate SQL database with the intent to make
          it publicly accessable online. This is now the third attempt to write
          The Motivator. This time everything was done using Vue with the
          intention of making hosting it as simple as possible. <br /><br />
