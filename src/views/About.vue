        This project started as a joke to help cheer up someone in my Tech Elevator class. This is now the third version. 
        The Motivator v1 was a simple command line interface written using jave in eclipse. The Motivator v2 was an attempt to us SpringMVC
        to integrate a database a seperate database with the intent to make it publicly accessable online. 
        This is now the third attempt to write The Motivator. This time I did everything in Vue with the intention of making hosting it as simple
        as possible. <br><br>
